# Self-Sovereign AGI (Rust Implementation)

A minimal, modular, and production-ready base implementation of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** built in **Rust**, integrating the [Self-Sovereign AI SDK](https://github.com/AI-Robotic-Labs/Self-Sovereign-AI-SDK).
This repository serves as a **foundation layer** for building autonomous, self-sovereign AI agents with decentralized identity, modular reasoning, and cryptographic trust.

## ✨ Features

* 🔒 **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** — Verifiable credentials & decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
* 🧠 **AGI Core Reasoning Loop** — Modular crate for agent cognition (perception → reasoning → action)
* 📦 **Crate-based Architecture** — Fully Rust-native, no Python bindings
* 🔗 **Pluggable Backends** — Integrates with external ZK-proofs, blockchains, or LLMs
* ⚡ **Async by Default** — Uses `tokio` for concurrency and scalability

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
self-sovereign-agi/
│── agi-core/        # Core reasoning & cognition engine
│── agi-identity/    # Decentralized identity & verifiable credentials
│── agi-memory/      # Long/short-term memory module
│── agi-exec/        # Action execution & environment interaction
│── examples/        # Demo agents and workflows
│── Cargo.toml
```

Each module is a **Rust crate**, published independently, but designed to interoperate.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Rust (≥1.80 stable)
* Cargo package manager
* Optional: local blockchain / ZK prover

### Installation

Clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/self-sovereign-agi.git
cd self-sovereign-agi
cargo build --release
```

Run example agent:

```bash
cargo run -p agi-exec --example simple_agent
```

---

## 🧩 Usage Example

```rust
use agi_core::Agent;
use agi_identity::Identity;
use agi_memory::Memory;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let id = Identity::new("did:example:123");
    let mut agent = Agent::new(id);

    agent.observe("The sky is turning red...");
    let action = agent.reason().await;
    agent.act(action).await;
}
```

## 🛡️ Production Readiness

* ✅ Modular crates published under `crates.io`
* ✅ Continuous integration with Rust `clippy` + tests
* ✅ Memory-safe, async, and concurrency-optimized
* ✅ No unsafe Rust

## 🌐 Roadmap

* [ ] Add ZK-proof enabled reasoning layer
* [ ] Blockchain + Lightning Network action executor
* [ ] Persistent decentralized memory (IPFS / Ceramic / OrbitDB)
* [ ] Multi-agent coordination
